If you wish to clone this project, you will need to create environment variables for the dynamic connection file to function as intended. 

-Two .env files are needed: .env.development and .env.test 
-Add 'PGDATABASE=nc_news' to .env.development
-Add 'PGDATABASE=nc_news_test' to .env.test

The relevant database names can also be found at /db/setup.sql. 

Double check that the .env files are .gitignored.
